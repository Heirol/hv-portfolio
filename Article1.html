          <h1>3 DIAMOND PRODUCT PROCESS</h1>
          <p>
            Product Management process has always been a bit messy and
            ill-defined. There are numerous artifacts and activities that most
            will generally agree take place, but sometimes these are missed and it
            is rarely clear whose responsibility they are, or in what order they
            should flow. To that end, I wanted to map out a process that I think
            makes sense, and that incorporates the major activities and artifacts
            that are part of more Product teams work.
          </p>

          <p>
            I started by leveraging the Double Diamond model from Design Thinking.
            I really like this model because it captures the nuance of divergent
            and convergent thinking which also makes sense here. In divergent
            thinking, we’re starting with input and exploding it out to all of its
            possibilities (brainstorming). With Convergence, we filter and
            synthesize those many pieces back down into a distilled output, that
            reflects those many possibilities that we identified. Take the Product
            Strategy diamond for example (the first diamond, shown above) – we
            take the Product Charter as input from Business about what we’ve been
            funded to do. We then go deep on market research to understand the
            customers we’re serving, the capabilities we can leverage, and the
            competitive landscape we must find a market position within. Once
            we’ve completed that divergent research, we distill (converge) all of
            that into a concise Product Vision that will drive our subsequent
            planning activities.
          </p>
          <p>
            The same approach is implied for each of the subsequent diamonds. In
            Planning, we ideate on all the possible projects that we’ll then score
            against our objectives, which helps to prioritize what we’ll work on.
            And in the Product Development diamond, the team conducts user
            research and prototyping exercises, in order to determine how to
            design the solution we will eventually release.
          </p>
          <h2>PROCESS STAGES</h2>
          <p class="sub-title">
            For reference, here is a summary of each of the major process stages
            (aka each diamond):
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>&#35;1 Opportunity Discovery</strong> &#45; In response to the
            product charter from business, we research the 3C&#39;s to understand
            the most impactful customers, the available technical capabilities and
            the competitive landscape we must position and differentiate our
            product in. The outcome of this process is a definition of a product
            vision and the objectives that will govern planning.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Market Research</li>
            <li>Internal Analysis</li>
            <li>Differentiated Value</li>
            <li>Product Vision</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>&#35;2 Product Planning</strong> &#45; Once the strategy is
            clear, planning is about identifying what to build, determining the
            structures by which to organize those efforts, ideating possible
            efforts and then prioritizing them as to how they align ultimately
            culminating in a roadmap that will govern product development.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Planning Themes</li>
            <li>Objectives & KPIs</li>
            <li>Project Ideation</li>
            <li>Teams/Missions</li>
            <li>Prioritization</li>
            <li>Product Roadmap</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>&#35;3 Product Development</strong> &#45; Feature projects and
            technical enablers (that will unlock future features) are the
            deliverables of product development. Starting with product
            requirements, the cross-functional teams work at this level to conduct
            user research, prototype solutions, design and development, test and
            iterate those solutions for the desired outcome.

            <li>Usability Research</li>
            <li>Prototyping</li>
            <li>Development</li>
            <li>Release Plan</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>PROCESS ARTIFACTS</h2>
          <p class="sub-title">
            Between each process state (diamond), are connectors that reflect th
            major artifacts that begin and conclude each state. Below is a brief
            description of each:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Product Charter</strong> &#45; This the definition from
              Business or the Product Council about exactly what they&#39;re
              funding, what resources are being made available, and what outputs
              are expected from that investment. This is what kicks off product
              strategy.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Product Vision</strong> &#45; The product vision is a
              concise statement that articulates what is being built, who it is
              for, why it is valuable, and how it will be differentiated.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Product Roadmap</strong> &#45; The plan for how the vision
              will be realized with tangible projects, to show how the provided
              resources will be applied to achieve the strategy.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Release Plan</strong> &#45; As the working teams, (aka
              “feature teams”) design and develop reach feature they may define a
              release plan (aka &#39;delivery plan&#39;) that indicates when and
              how the feature will be deployed and launched.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>ANOTHER WAY OF LOOKING AT IT</h2>
          <p>
            Below is a more flowing illustration of the same conceptual model. The
            process flows top-down, beginning with market research and
            identification of market opportunities. Then in planning, we ideate
            and merge those ideas with opportunities to determine priorities.
            Those priorities inform the roadmap (aka plan). The feature projects
            on the roadmap are then broken down into requirements for design &
            development, and a release plan finally indicates how/when those
            features will be delivered.
          </p>
          <img src="/files/process-sequence-1024x537.png" alt="" />
          <h2>PLANNING ALIGNMENT</h2>
          <p>
            In this last view, I think it is helpful to articulate all of the
            planning objects and how they relate (think object-oriented design for
            this one). The vision is the originating object that responds to the
            business charter. Objectives are derived to support the vision. Themes
            and major initiatives are then identified and mapped to those
            objectives. Feature projects are ideated for how to implement those
            themes. Each feature project is comprised of requirements (aka User
            Stories in Agile speak), and finally, the actual work tasks are broken
            out for each requirement &#45; those are grayed out here since those
            work activities are owned by the team and merely respond to the plan,
            rather than being part of it.
          </p>

          <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
          <p>
            Hopefully, this provides a useful model that teams can implement and
            build a structure around. What I&#39;ve come to realize over the
            years, is that alignment is the most important outcome we&#39;re
            trying to achieve in Product leadership. That means aligning up to
            Business strategy, to the sides with stakeholders and their respective
            functional strategies, as well as down to the team to ensure they
            understand the decision-making fabric, where they fit in and how to
            effectively contribute, which helps to reduce overlap and misplaced
            expectations that sometimes come with being the &#39;CEO of the
            Product&#39;. In my next article, I&#39;ll discuss optimal team
            architecture, which this in place as a foundation.
